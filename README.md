# Reddit kataskopos

κατάσκοπος(katáskopos) means spy in ancient Greek. This project aims to get the top 5 posts from a subreddit easily without authenticating

## Use it from telegram

The only available command for now is `/search whateverSubreddit`. Chat with the bot [here](https://t.me/RedditKataskoposBot).
It will show you 5 posts with 25 upvotes or more from the last 6 months. In each query it will shuffle the results in order to
minimize that the same post appears in two subsequent searches.

Example of telegram usage:
